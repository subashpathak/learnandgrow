<h2>Notes from the interview:</h2>
<ul>
<li>AI can help doctors free their time:
<ul>
<li>Physicians are burned out in their work often</li>
<li>2/3 of doctors activity get focused on typing at the keyboard…wastes time</li>
<li>Use voice from AI instead of keyboards and saves time for patient-doctor interaction</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Idea of deep medicine: More deeply we understand a patient’s data, the better we will be to respond to their health issues individually.</li>
<li>Deep phenotyping: Characterizing patient in many different layers eg: anatomy trhough skin, physiology through sensors, environment through sensors.</li>
<li>AI collects all phenotyping data about the person and helps diagnosis of diseases like UTIs,skin rashes, skin cancer,ear infection accurately.</li>
<li>You don’t need to see doctor for the diagnosis of simple diseases. Lots of routine things which are not of serious nature will be offloaded to patients.</li>
<li>Virtual Medical coach: Avatar on smartphone that collects all your health related data like heartbeat, blood pressure, genome and microbiome. It gives feedback about your health on real time.</li>
<li>Nearest neighbor analysis: Matches people with similar genomes and what worked for them in different treatment situations</li>
<li>AI is a vital part of personalized medicine development</li>
<li><p>In UK, some hospitals have avoided using keyboards and use voice instead</p></li>
<li>Danger of AI: Not accurate prediction of health outcomes and needs tons of improvement</li>
<li><p>AI can accurately and effectively recognize images and patterns which could be time consuming for doctors.</p></li>
